# WeirdConstructor's Rust Code Snippets/Projects for the rp2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico)

A link to the resource / link collection I made: ![rp2040 Rust resources](resources.md)

An overview of this repository:

- [8-Bit PWM DAC with an RC filter synthesizing sine and saw waveforms](pwm_dac_saw_sampling)
- [WS2812 on the Raspberry Pi Pico with Rust](ws2812_led_cube)
- [SD/MMC Card with FAT32 filesystem via SPI on Raspberry Pi Pico](sd_card_spi)
  If you search for a nicer documented example also have a look at my PR
  for `rp-hal`: https://github.com/WeirdConstructor/rp-hal/blob/pico_sd_card_example/boards/rp-pico/examples/pico_spi_sd_card.rs
